I'm Alex, a 2nd-year PhD student in Robotics & Control at UC Berkeley, working in Professor Murat Arcak's group.
Before joining UC Berkeley, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science at McGill University.
My undergraduate thesis on multi-robot exploration was supervised by Prof. Greg Dudek, and I am grateful to have conducted research under the supervision of Prof. Hsiu-Chin Lin and Prof. James Richard Forbes.

My research focus alternates between data-driven control methods using Gaussian Processes, and multi-agent systems.
I am particularly interested in combining the guarantees of control with the accuracy and generality of data-driven methods.
My current research thrusts include:

- using Gaussian Processes to learn unmodeled dynamics,
- adapting reinforcement learning for high-dimensional action spaces,
- and coordinating heterogeneous agents for ocean monitoring.
