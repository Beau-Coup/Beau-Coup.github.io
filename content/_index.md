I'm a 2nd-year PhD student in Robotics & Control at UC Berkeley, working under the supervision of Professor Murat Arcak.
Before joining UC Berkeley, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics and Computer Science at McGill University.
My undergraduate thesis was supervised by Prof. Greg Dudek, and I am grateful to have conducted research under the supervision of Prof. Hsiu-Chin Lin and Prof. James Richard Forbes.

My research focuses on developing intelligent multi-agent systems that can cooperate and interact with the world.
I'm particularly interested in:

- collaborative manipulation of objects,
- competitive autonomous teams,
- and applications of Physics in ML and AI.
